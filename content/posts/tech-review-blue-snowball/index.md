Well, it’s time for my first tech review! Today, I’m gonna be talking about my new microphone, the Blue Snowball! You may have heard of its older brother, the Blue Yeti, which is a professional-grade large microphone, but Blue, a Logitech brand, made another microphone, called the Blue Snowball.

The Blue Snowball is half the price of the Yeti at 49.99, and is half the size. It sports a unique design, with a three-legged stand and a ball-shaped microphone.

On my previous mic, the Tonor TC-777, there were so many issues. The mic constantly cut out, and sometimes the mic broke and outputted no audio. The audio itself was terrible. My mic picked up every vibration my desk made while I typed on my keyboard. The vocals were muffled, my keyboard sounded terrible, and my computer fan was extremely loud. For the same price, get this instead.

When I got my new mic, the difference was night and day. My keyboard sounded phenomenal, my voice was clear, and no desk thumps were heard. My only complaint was that my fan was a bit too loud for my liking, but it was a lot quieter than before. That problem can be easily fixed however.

The build quality on this mic is insanely good. It feels like a well built mic, unlike my old one. I feel like I own a real professional mic. However, design wise, I am not a huge fan. The mic looks weird on my desk, and the ball shaped head is quite irregular. The stand, however, is phenomenal. I don’t like having the logo on the mic head itself, but that’s just nitpicking.

To sum it up, the Blue Snowball is a great mic. The audio is great, but the design could be better. For $50, it’s a great bang-for-the-buck option for a mic.

Thanks for tuning in.
