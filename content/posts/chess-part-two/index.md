Last week, I went over openings. Let’s recap the basics:

Always attack the center. The center is comprised of these 4 squares:

Algebraic notation is like the coordinate system for chess. ABC’s for the x axis, and numbers for the y axis. Each piece has a letter designated for its moves. X is for killing. Let’s see an example:

If the knight were to take the pawn on e4, it would be written as Nxe4.

Okay, let’s continue. Let’s look at some more advanced openings. Here are some fun ones.

This is called Scholar’s mate. It uses a mating trap with the Queen. Traps are where the other side cannot see mate.

It attacks the vulnerable f7 square. White attacks the square with the Queen, and protects the queen using the bishop. This is really funny if you can pull this off with the Queen. Also, you may notice the Knight coming to attack the Queen. This is a beginner’s move, because the beginner cannot see the mate.

Moving on, let’s take a look at some gambits. Gambits are where a piece is offered, but if you take it it will have major repercussions. A simple gambit is the Queen’s gambit:

White is offering the pawn, but in return white gains control of the entire center. Black generally declines by protecting its pawn.

Thanks for reading!
