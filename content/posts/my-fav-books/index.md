I love to read. Like, LOVE to read. As such, there are some books I loved and some books I hated. So here is my rundown of all my favorite books!

But before we begin, I’d like to thank our sponsor, my YouTube channel! *shameless plug* I post Minecraft a few times every week. I’m trying to hit 100 subscribers by 2022, so it would mean a lot if you subscribed! Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmrt6zbA6h9DqWjHTPwexg) to subscribe.

Okay, back to books. I loved reading as a kid. One of the few things that really got me into reading was this comic strip called Calvin and Hobbes. I still to this day love this series. This comic has something to offer to every age, from 6 to 60. The comic is about the adventures of a sarcastic six year old named Calvin and stuffed tiger Hobbes. He pretends that his tiger is real, and the comic deals with a variety of topics and issues, including some really tough issues. I recommend that EVERYONE read this comic. It truly is a masterpiece.

Next up, we have one the best fiction series of all time, the Percy Jackson series. This series revolves the concept that the Greek Gods still exist to this day, and they live in New York! This fun, light-hearted series follows Percy Jackson and his friends trying to thwart the evil Titans from rising and overtaking Olympus. This series is really well written for elementary and middle school students. Would definitely recommend.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a great intro to anybody getting into sci-fi. Funny and filled with science jokes and puns, this classic is great for enjoyment reading.

Keeping on the trail of sci-fi, The Gravity Keeper is a great book series about sci-fi. Enter Simon Bloom’s world where a book falls on his head. Literally. The book gives him and his friends the ability to manipulate physics, but he must use these newfound powers to defeat a powerful enemy. Can he do it? Find out in the book.

The Ares Program is a space program run by NASA. The goal is simple for the 5 astronauts on this ambitious trip: to study Mars. Due to an accident, Watney wakes up to find that the crew left him alone. He is now all alone on a planet 100 million miles away from Earth. Against all odds, he survives using his wits and strength. Through humorous narration by Watney, and glimpses of what is happening on Earth, the tale of Mark Watney on a lonely planet far far far away from Earth is a gripping story. Will he survive or not? Find out in The Martian by Andy Weir.

Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is the tale of the life of Steve Jobs, from birth to death. This book has a personal connection to me, because it was the first real nonfiction book I read. All of Walter Isaacson’s books are amazing, but this one is truly one of a kind.

That’s it for this week! I hope you enjoyed!
