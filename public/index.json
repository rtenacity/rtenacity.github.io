[{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u0026rdquo; - George Santayana\nThe present can seem like a very unstable and turbulent time. It seems as if the world is splitting itself apart, becoming more polarized and opinionated. However, to understand the direction the world is headed, we need to look back in the past for answers.\nNow, Hegel is notorious for being incredibly difficult to read. His works are often long-winded and use poor english to convey his thoughts. However, his ideas are incredibly important to understand. However, one of his ideas is incredibly important to understand: the dialectic. When broken down, the dialectic is not a very complicated idea.\nThe dialectic refers to a method of reasoning and argumentation that involves the examining opposing ideas. It contains three parts: the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The thesis and antithesis are opposing ideas. The synthesis is the the merging of the two ideas, reconciling them to form a new idea that contains good attributes of both the thesis and antithesis. It is often associated with philosophical traditions and has been used as a tool for intellectual inquiry and debate throughout history.\nHegel\u0026rsquo;s dialectical reasoning states that history progresses through a series of conflicts and resolutions. According to Hegel, the current world order can be viewed as the thesis. New, opposing ideas that are in conflict with the current world order are the antithesis. The synthesis is the new world order that is formed after the conflict between the thesis and antithesis is resolved.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a diagram of the dialectic:\nHegel used the example of the French Revolution to explain his idea. The French Monarchy was the thesis, the current world order. The drastic opposite of the French Monarchy was the French Revolution, the antithesis. The synthesis was the new world order that was formed after the French Revolution, which was the French Republic.\nUsing the dialectic, we can visualize the modern day as just a series of Hegelian dialectics. I think the best example of this is the current state of affairs in Israel. This involves two applications of the dialectic at a broad level:\nOrigins:\nThesis: Pre-1948 Jewish Migration and Zionist Movement The Jewish diaspora and persecution throughout history laid the foundation for the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The Jewish migration to Palestine increased during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to conflicts with the Arab population already residing there. Antithesis: Arab Nationalism and Anti-Zionist Sentiment The rise of Arab nationalism coincided with the growing Jewish presence in Palestine. Tensions escalated as the Arab population expressed opposition to the Zionist movement, fearing dispossession of their land and the establishment of a Jewish state. Synthesis: 1947 UN Partition Plan and Creation of Israel In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. While the Jewish leadership accepted the plan, Arab states and Palestinian Arabs rejected it, leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Israel declared independence in 1948, leading to a synthesis of sorts by establishing a Jewish state but failing to resolve the broader conflict. Current state:\nNew Thesis: Post-1948 Arab-Israeli Conflicts and Occupation The establishment of Israel led to ongoing hostilities between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, including wars in 1956, 1967, and 1973. The Israeli victory in the 1967 Six-Day War resulted in the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and other territories, leading to further tensions and resistance from Palestinians. New Antithesis: Palestinian Nationalism and Intifadas Palestinian nationalism emerged as a response to Israeli occupation, leading to the formation of organizations such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). The First Intifada (1987-1993) and the Second Intifada (2000-2005) saw widespread Palestinian uprisings against Israeli control, with both sides engaging in violent confrontations. At the current state, there is no synthesis. However, the Hegelian synthesis can take decades to come to fruition, as seen with the French Revolution.\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict is just one example, but nearly every single current social or political issue can be visualized through the Hegelian dialectic.\nExpect more philosophy to come. - RA\n","permalink":"https://rohanarni.com/posts/hegel-modern-day/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u0026rdquo; - George Santayana\nThe present can seem like a very unstable and turbulent time.

From the silvery moon rising in the sky to the tiny pinpricks of light we now know as stars and planets, humans have spent countless hours observing and documenting the night sky. The process began as far back as the Babylonians and their written record of the night sky, to the Mesoamerican civilizations who based a large majority of their calendar on the moon, and then the Indian and Arabic civilizations with their massive technological advancements to help observe the night sky.\nThen the Europeans began to observe, with the Dutch glass-maker Hans Lippershey creating the first telescope. Galileo and Kepler further improved on the telescope, documenting new properties of the night sky and unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Then the age of large observatories dawned upon us, and we learned to capture images using radio telescopes instead of just optical telescopes. We became so obsessed with the night sky that we actually sent a multitude of telescopes into space just so that we could help see the night sky better. In fact, we just sent one last year with the most cutting-edge technology that humanity has ever developed.\nBased on the information above, I think we can all agree that the night sky is intricately connected to humanity. The night sky makes its way into our art and culture as well. But no other piece shows the intricate connection between humans and the night sky quite like “The Starry Night” by van Gogh. The picture seems innocent enough, a very post-impressionist depiction of a village in the night. But there is so much more beneath the innocent disguise of “The Starry Night”. Van Gogh was a deeply troubled man, and when he ended up cutting his ear off in a psychotic fit, he checked himself into a mental asylum to help himself.\nIn this asylum, van Gogh began to reflect on his life, and art became his therapy. He began to paint while he slowly recovered from his trauma. Before he had fully come to terms with himself, he produced “The Starry Night”, the epitome of the human experience. As he gazed on the night sky in wonder, he painted with a touch that is deeply human. The bold, defiant strokes on the canvas represent his newfound hope for the future, but the swirling paint reflects his emotional turmoil and uncertainty. The vibrant and dynamic use of color, coupled with van Gogh\u0026rsquo;s bold brushstrokes, creates a feeling of movement and energy that draws the viewer into the painting. The combination of the night sky\u0026rsquo;s peaceful beauty with the intensity of the brushwork creates a contrast that is both striking and captivating.\nIn my opinion, \u0026ldquo;The Starry Night\u0026rdquo; is a must-see for anyone who appreciates art and its power to evoke emotions. Over a century after its creation, the painting continues to captivate audiences, making it a true testament to van Gogh\u0026rsquo;s talent and vision.\nI give “The Starry Night” five stars.\n","permalink":"https://rohanarni.com/posts/starry-night/","summary":"Since the dawn of human civilization, the night sky has captivated us in a way that no other object has.

This case lives in obscurity to most citizens, but without it, the Supreme Court would not have the power it has today. The issue of the case arose from a seemingly simple dispute. It all began during the Election of 1800. When incumbent president John Adams was voted out of office, he created a scheme to keep his party, the Federalists, in control of one of the branches of the government. Adams promoted many Federalists to become circuit judges and justices of peace. This way, the Federalist party could control the Judicial Branch of the government. However, one man that was promised a commission, William Marbury, never received one before Jefferson came into office. Jefferson declared the commission void and told his Secretary of State, James Madison, to not deliver the commission. Marbury sued Madison, and the court case began. The Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison changed America for the better because it established the principle of judicial review, increased the power of the Supreme Court, and protected the rights of citizens.\nFirst of all, the case created the principle of judicial review. Judicial review states that the Supreme Court can declare an act of the government “unconstitutional”. This gave the Supreme Court power, and proved that the Judicial branch was a separate entity from the other branches. This principle arose from the court case itself. When the case was brought to the Supreme Court, Marshall realized something. The law Congress passed which allowed the Supreme Court to review this case expanded the power of the Supreme Court beyond what was specified in the Constitution. Marshall realized that went against the Constitution, and struck down that part of the law, creating the first example of judicial review. In Marshall’s own words, “The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written.” Due to the fact that the Supreme Court no longer had jurisdiction of this case, the Supreme Court could not make Madison deliver Marbury’s commission.\nAlong with a legal problem, the case created a great political dilemma for Marshall. Ruling with Marbury and asking Madison and Jefferson to deliver Marbury’s commission would appear weak, because Madison and Jefferson could just as easily ignore the order. This would be a crippling blow to the new court, who needed to appear strong and powerful. However, by siding with Madison, Marshall, a Federalist, would be handing Jefferson and Madison, Democratic-Republicans, a free victory, and would look like the Supreme Court was backing down. Marshall’s next decision is single-handedly the most important legal decision in the history of the United States.\nJohn Marshall\nMarshall, figured out a way that the Supreme Court didn’t have to make a decision on the case. Section 13 of the Judiciary Act, the act that allowed the case to take place, expanded the role of the Supreme Court beyond what was specified in the Constitution. Declaring the act unconstitutional, Marshall ended Marbury v. Madison due to the fact that the case was beyond the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In the words of political historian Robert McCloskey, “[Marbury v. Madison] is a masterwork of indirection, a brilliant example of Marshall’s capacity to sidestep danger while seeming to court it.”\nMarbury v. Madison also increased the power of the Supreme Court tremendously. By setting the precedent of allowing the Supreme Court to strike down acts of the government, Marshall single-handedly set apart the Supreme Court from other branches of the government. This allowed for the Supreme Court to strike down acts of the government that could potentially harm the citizens of America. This power, however, has not gone without backlash. One argument is that the courts sometimes do not represent the beliefs of the people because judges are not elected. This goes against the principle of democracy. As Jeremy Waldron said in the Yale Law Journal, “Second, it argues that, quite apart from the outcomes it generates, judicial review is democratically illegitimate.” Waldron also states that the people may not be better off with the Supreme Court, as there is no guarantee that the Court would be any better than any political institution, such as Congress. In his words, “…it argues that there is no reason to suppose that rights are better protected by this practice than they would be by democratic legislatures.” However, it is hard for many lawyers and jurists to argue with Marshall’s statement in his verdict, “that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.” This shows the power of judicial review as being able to strike down pretty much any law to protect citizens.\nArguably the most famous example of judicial review protecting the rights of citizens is the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education. Brown v. Board of Education was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that outlawed racial segregation in very public schools. The case generally was filed on behalf of Linda Brown, an African-American girl who had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop in order to get to her segregated black school while white children were able to mostly walk to their school bus stop right outside their homes. The court ruled unanimously that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” The Brown v Board of Education case is one of the most important cases in US history because it overturned the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which had allowed for “separate but equal” facilities for African Americans and whites, paving the way for integration across all aspects of American life in a big way. This court case was a great example of judicial review, because it protected the rights and quality of life of African-Americans.\nAnother example of judicial review is the court case Miranda v. Arizona. Miranda v. Arizona is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is one of the most influential cases in American history and has shaped modern law enforcement practices in the US. The case revolved around Ernesto Miranda, who was arrested on March 13, 1963, for kidnapping and rape in Phoenix, Arizona. The court ruled that Miranda’s confession could not be used as evidence because he had not been informed of his rights. The court ruled 5–4 that Miranda’s confession should not have been admitted as evidence because he had not been informed of his right to remain silent or have an attorney present during questioning. The case was brought to the Supreme Court by Ernesto Miranda, who had been convicted of kidnapping and rape based on his confession, which he later claimed was coerced. The court ruled that Miranda’s Fifth Amendment right to due process had been violated because he had not been informed of his right to remain silent or have an attorney present during questioning. The Supreme Court ruled that statements made by a person to police officers after being taken into custody are admissible as evidence in court only if the person was first informed of their Constitutional rights, which are: (1) to remain silent; (2) to have an attorney present during questioning; and (3) to be free from self-incrimination. These are a few examples of how judicial review protects the rights of citizens.\nTo sum it all up, Marbury v. Madison changed America for the better by creating the principle of judicial review, increased the power of the Supreme Court, and protected the rights of citizens. Judicial review was created to prevent the Supreme Court from making a difficult decision that would either give a win to the opposing political party or make the court seem weak. Judicial review allows the Supreme Court to strike down an act of the government due to the act violating the Constitution. Judicial review allows the Supreme Court more power, and with that power, the Supreme Court protects the rights of citizens. Should the Supreme Court have this much power?\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2022 on my old blog on medium. I am reposting it here for archival purposes.

Madison: The First Supreme Court Case"},{"content":"This article is about a project I did with my Ev3 robot in which I made my Ev3 robot follow a toy car. This is similar to some features that many modern cars have today known as adaptive cruise control.. Let’s break this project down into three aspects: the thought process, the hardware, and the software.\nThe thought process is quite simple. I was inspired by my parents’ car, the Lexus RX 350. It has a feature that follows the car in front of it by keeping a constant distance from the other car. It can also speed up and down based on the speed of the other car. I thought that this would be quite easy to model with the Ev3 using principles from the PID line following algorithm. PID is an algorithm that “proportionally” follows a line. (I made a PID line follower on Github, which you can check out here) The algorithm uses how far away the robot is from the line to judge how much the robot should turn. Using the idea of proportionally following a target, I thought instead of following a line, I could make the robot follow a car.\nThe physical aspect of the robot is quite simple. I built a car that was modeled behind a formula one car (for the cool factor). It has an ultrasonic sensor on the front part of the car and a touch sensor on the back. The robot also has two large motors in the back for driving, and also has steering capabilities using the medium motor. However, I have disabled the steering capabilities to prevent the robot from veering.\nSide view\nTop view\nNow, let’s break down the code. The code can be found at my repository here.\n#!/usr/bin/python # coding: utf-8 # this program lets your ev3 follow a toy car accurately from ev3dev2.motor import * from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import UltrasonicSensor, GyroSensor, InfraredSensor, TouchSensor from ev3dev2.led import Leds from ev3dev2.sound import Sound from sys import stderr from time import sleep` These lines are just imports from the necessary libraries. `left_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_C) right_motor = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_D) us = UltrasonicSensor() ts = TouchSensor()` These lines are just so that I can reference these items easily later in the program.\ncorrection = 0 kp = 1 power = 60 target = 10 This is where things begin to get interesting. The variable correction is just a blank variable for now. This will be used later in the program.\nThe variable kp, also known as the “constant of proportionality”, is the factor which changes how sharp the movement is. I’ve left it as the default value of 1.\nPower is the base speed of the car. I’ve set it to 60, which means that the motor is going at 60% full power as a baseline.\nTarget is the target range from the toy car to the Ev3. I’ve set it to 10 cm.\nleft_motor.run_direct() right_motor.run_direct() These lines start the motors.\nwhile True: error = target - us.distance_centimeters Error is the difference between the target value and the distance value. This will come in handy for the proportional line following.\nif ts.value(): break This line turns the touch sensor into a killswitch by breaking out of the while true loop.\nif error \u0026amp;lt; 0: correction = (abs(float(error)/5))*kp if (correction+power) \u0026amp;gt;= 100 or (correction+power) \u0026amp;lt;= -100: correction = -(power) If error is less than 0, the Ev3 is too far from the car. The variable correction is error divided by 5 multiplied by the kp (constant of proportionality). Correction is added to power to change the final wheel speed, which speeds up the car (not shown here).\nThe second if statement is just to make sure the final wheel speed is not above 100 or less than -100, otherwise the robot will error out.\nif error \u0026amp;gt; 0: correction = -(power) If error is more than 0, the Ev3 is too close to the car. The car stops by making correction the inverse of power, which makes the final wheel speed equal to 0.\nif error == 0: correction = -(power) If error is equal than 0, the Ev3 is the perfect distance from the car, which makes the Ev3 stop. The car stops by making correction the inverse of power, which makes the final wheel speed equal to 0.\nif us.distance_centimeters == 255.0: correction = -(power) The ultrasonic sensor has an error where it randomly reads 255 cm, so this line makes sure it doesn’t glitch out and mess up the algorithm by making the car stop. The car stops by making correction the inverse of power, which makes the final wheel speed equal to 0.\nprint(str(target)+\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;+str(us.distance_centimeters)+\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;+str(error)+\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;+str(correction)) This line is for debugging. It prints out the values of each of the important variables to figure out any issues with the robot.\nleft_motor.duty_cycle_sp= int(-(power + correction)) right_motor.duty_cycle_sp= int(-(power + correction)) These lines set the final wheel speed. I made the value negative because my robot’s wheels are backward.\nsleep(0.1) This line makes sure that the CPU doesn’t overheat.\nleft_motor.stop() right_motor.stop() When the touch sensor breaks the loop, these lines make sure that the robot’s motors stop.\nAnd that’s it!\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.

I’ve been pretty busy, but I didn’t write because I was very lazy. So anyways, I’m back! Let’s get into today’s topic!\nChina. You can’t read the news without hearing about China. China is predicted to take over the US as the number one global superpower by 2032, and some estimate that to be even earlier. But how did this happen? As always, when you look at a topic, start with the basics. How did China begin, and how did their beginning differ from the US? Let’s dive into the birth of China.\nChina is almost 4000 years older than the US. China was founded in 2070 BCE, with the start of the Xia dynasty. They fell 400 years after, and soon the Qin dynasty arrived. The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty to unite China together. They created a strong sense of unity by imposing strict restrictions on the people. The dynasty didn’t last long, and the Han dynasty rose. The Han dynasty was the most important dynasty because they united all of what we know as Eastern China, which is where the majority of the population lives to this day. They created the feeling of national unity, which ties most of the population together today. The Hans tied together China.\nFast forward to the American revolution. Britain is broke after a very expensive war with the American colonies, and now they cannot rely on the colonies to fund them anymore. The British are huge traders with the Chinese, and they export lots of goods such as spices and silk in exchange for silver. Britain is starting to run into a trade deficit with China, and they are struggling to find a product to trade with China. After some failed negotiations with the Emperor of China to try to get the Chinese to import some British goods, the British have an idea. They have plenty of opium from Bengal, and they start to export that opium into the country. This is disastrous for the Chinese, as most Chinese citizens get addicted to opium. China tried to restrict the import of opium, but it ended up escalating into a full-scale naval war. In the end, China fell to the British in 1912, ending the Imperial rule of China.\nThe People’s Republic of China was formally established on October 1, 1949. After a long Civil war between the political parties, the Nationalist Party (or the Democratic Party) and the Communist Party, the CCP emerged victorious, driving the Nationalist Party to Taiwan to create more issues for the world later. But for now, the leadership of China was rock-solid.\nChina was formed on the ideals of unity. China has a one-party system, leaning into its imperialistic roots by creating a one-party rule. America, however, was created on the idea of independence. Every person is different, and the idea of independence runs in America’s history.\nA country that is not a free-market democracy succeeding is a new concept for many. But the concept that a country has to be free to be successful is a western concept. Clearly, that concept is up for debate, due to the overwhelming success of China. China cannot be explained in typical western concepts, which is what makes China so complex to most experts. It is simply impossible to explain China with western ideals. As time goes on, the idea that the west is the golden standard for a country will fade, and other cultures and concepts will arise, similar to China. One thing is for sure, and that the gold standard of westernization is over. And it’s all thanks to China’s history.\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.

Today, let’s dive in to the true nature of the periodic table.\nAt a first glance, the periodic table looks like a childish table with all sorts of colors and silly letters. Most people know that those letters stand for elements. What are elements really?\nElements are atoms. Atoms are comprised of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons, electrons, and neutrons determine which element it is. It also determines the properties of each element.\nElements have an atomic number and an atomic weight. An atomic number is the order in which it is on the periodic table. The atomic weight is the weight of all the components in the atom.\nThe periodic table are arranged in periods and columns. All the elements in one period have the same number of electron shells, and all the electron in one column have the same number of electrons in its outer, or valence, shell.\nThis is demonstrated by looking at the first column of the periodic table. All have one electron it its valence shell. This leads to a volatile metal (or gas, in the case of hydrogen), especially when it comes in contact with water. This is why sodium, an element in the first column, is known for its reaction with water.\nThere are 7 groups on the periodic table. There are Alkali Metals, Alkaline Earth Metals, Transition Metals, Metalloids, Other Metals, Non-metals, Halogens, Noble Gases and Rare Earth Elements. These all share similar characteristics. For example, the noble gases are known for not interacting with other elements.\nStay tuned for next week, where we go over some examples and go into further detail!\nThanks for reading!\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.

When it was first released, it was the hottest game to ever come out. A simple yet unique game. There was no clear objective in the game. It was an infinite world with the capability to do anything. No fancy graphics, no violent gore. How did such a simple game become so popular across the world? Today, let’s look at the rise, fall, and rise again of Minecraft.\nMinecraft was initially released as Minecraft Classic in 2009. It looked like this:\nA far cry from the current state of the game. It had crude graphics, unintuitive controls, and terrible world generation. But it was a smash hit. Features upon features were stacked until, in 2011, version 1.0 was released.\nThis game was on the charts, and it was going crazy. It quite literally popped off. Interest grew exponentially. Console versions came out, mobile versions came out, you couldn’t go on the internet without seeing Minecraft. Subcultures grew around the game, such as speedrunning, minigames, PvP, and LPs. It seemed that Minecraft could never fall.\nBut as most good things do, the game didn’t last forever. In 2016, the game dropped in interest, favoring more trendy games such as Fortnite. For 3 years, Minecraft stagnated as a low-interest dead game. Only serious players would play the game. But then something insane happened. Minecraft rose back from the dead.\nIt all started with Pewdiepie. In June 2019, he released a video called “Minecraft Part 1”, in which he plays a survival world. This instantly brought back the community of Minecraft. Then, riding off the revival of Minecraft, Keemstar started an event called Minecraft Monday. It was a PvP/Minigame based game in which popular youtubers fought each other. There were teams of 2, and the winners of the event get 5k each. On week 1, a relatively unknown youtuber and his friend won the event. His name was Technoblade.\nTechnoblade was a hardcore Minecraft PvPer since 2014. He gained popularity from his videos on the SkyWars gamemode on Hypixel in 2016, Minecraft’s most popular gamemode at the time. He then went on to dominate BedWars, a newly released game. He got on the leaderboards, and got the largest winstreak of 1000 that wasn’t dethroned for a long time to come.\nHe got an invite to Minecraft Monday, and absolutely destroyed everyone there. Over the event’s 14 week run, Techno won 4 times and placed on the leaderboards almost every time, even though the event hosts teamed him up with weak teammates.\nHe didn’t stop there, however. He joined Skyblock, Hypixel’s most popular gamemode to this day, and raced im_a_squid_kid to 500 million potatoes farmed, and won using mind games and tactics. He also participated in a event called MCU, and beat the record for most kills in an event and won a 15v3 in the deathmatch.\nThen, Dream happened.\nDream was a prominent figure in the Minecraft community, known for speedrunning. However, he started a youtube channel, and went from 9k to 1m in record time. He grew his channel from doing popular challenges, such as the manhunt challenge. The manhunt challenge is when Dream tries to beat the game but his friends try to hunt him down and kill him.\nPeople couldn’t help but wonder, who was better? Dream, the renowned speedrunner known for his tactics, or Techno, known for his raw PvP and skill?\nThat question was soon answered.\nMr. Beast, a popular youtuber, created a $100k duel between Dream and Techno. Now, we need to establish something. In Minecraft, there are 2 types of PvP. 1.8.9 PvP, and 1.9+ PvP. In 1.8.9, you needed to click as fast as possible to hit your opponents as much as possible to kill them. In 1.9+ PvP, you need to time your hits. Techno mained 1.8.9, and Dream mained 1.9+ PvP. So a compromise was made. 10 rounds, 5 in 1.8.9, and 5 in 1.9+. The duel was the biggest gaming duel of all time. Who won?\nTechno won. They split the prize, but it was a close fight. There was months of preparation and training for these duels.\nThen, the Dream SMP happened.\nSMP means survival multi-player, and SMPs have been made in the past. However, there has never been an SMP as popular as the Dream SMP.\nMany youtubers blew up from the SMP, such as TommyInnit, Hannahxxrose, and Purpled. This is the most popular Minecraft has ever been.\nSo this is where we are today. Has Minecraft peaked, or will it keep going? Who knows?\nThanks for reading! Stay tuned!\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium. I am reposting it here for archival purposes.

Just like the Theory of Evolution should be called Evolution. The Big Bang is the cosmic event that started the entire universe. So what exactly happened? Well, it took scientists years to find out what exactly happened, but we finally have a somewhat complete idea of what happened.\nThis whole thing started with a singularity. The singularity is our whole universe, compressed into something smaller than a grain of sand. It’s even smaller than an atom. So for whatever reason, it implodes. Like, it goes KABOOM. All the information of the universe balloons out at blinding speed. This is where things start to get kooky.\nThere are 4 fundamental forces in physics: Electromagnetism, Gravity, the Strong, and the Weak force. At the beginning of the universe, all these 4 forces were united. As time passed on, (by time I mean a few milliseconds), these forces split off from one another. Gravity was the first to jump ship. Strong leaves next, leaving the “Electroweak” force left. Then those two split. A main goal of physics in the 21st century is to mathematically prove that all four forces can exist in the quantum model. The EM, strong, and weak force all fit into the quantum model because they all have force carrying particles. But gravity does not. What’s a force carrying particle? Check this page out.\nSo now we have 4 distinct forces. But we don’t have protons and neutrons yet. That’s because they are made of quarks, a fundamental particle. It was too hot for the quarks to come together. Now, with the temperature cooled slightly, the quarks could come together. But nothing would happen for another 400 thousand years. It was too hot for atoms to form. Then elements formed, then stars, then heavy elements, then planets, then earth, then life, and you know the rest.\nI hope you enjoyed this article!\n(It was also Einstein’s birthday on the day of writing.)\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.

Let’s recap the basics:\nAlways attack the center. The center is comprised of these 4 squares:\nAlgebraic notation is like the coordinate system for chess. ABC’s for the x axis, and numbers for the y axis. Each piece has a letter designated for its moves. X is for killing. Let’s see an example:\nIf the knight were to take the pawn on e4, it would be written as Nxe4.\nOkay, let’s continue. Let’s look at some more advanced openings. Here are some fun ones.\nThis is called Scholar’s mate. It uses a mating trap with the Queen. Traps are where the other side cannot see mate.\nIt attacks the vulnerable f7 square. White attacks the square with the Queen, and protects the queen using the bishop. This is really funny if you can pull this off with the Queen. Also, you may notice the Knight coming to attack the Queen. This is a beginner’s move, because the beginner cannot see the mate.\nMoving on, let’s take a look at some gambits. Gambits are where a piece is offered, but if you take it it will have major repercussions. A simple gambit is the Queen’s gambit:\nWhite is offering the pawn, but in return white gains control of the entire center. Black generally declines by protecting its pawn.\nThanks for reading!\n","permalink":"https://rohanarni.com/posts/chess-part-two/","summary":"Last week, I went over openings.

So obviously, there are competitions surrounding the robot. I participated in two of them. How did it go? Let’s find out.\nLet’s establish some context. My friend invited me to a robotics competition that his dad coached in summer of 2019. It was called First Lego League. It was all about making the Mindstorms Robot move around on this mat and do tasks on the mat, called missions. This is what the mat looked like:\nFLL Mat As you can see, there are little Lego structures scattered around the mat that the robot must go to and complete missions there. Missions award you points. There are three rounds. The round with the highest points counts. At the end of the he top three teams make it to the next round.\nIn the 2019–2020 competition, we used something called RobotC to control the Ev3. It was a version of C that the Ev3 understands. Crappy program, always crashed, but it got the job done.\nIn the 2020–2021 competition however, everything changed. We used something called Ev3Dev, which is a Linux distro for the Ev3. That way, we could use python to control the robot. However, the bootup time for the program is very high. So we used the buttons on the robot to run programs. The way it worked is that you have a main execute script, which links to files that contain the code for all missions. It also connects to a script which processes the button inputs. Here is a diagram showing the way out setup worked:\nDiagram Let’s look at the software design.\nThis is the launcher code:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3 from ev3dev2.motor import * from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import * from ev3dev2.button import * from ev3dev2.wheel import * from ev3dev2.sound import * import library steering = MoveSteering(OUTPUT_C, OUTPUT_B) motor = MediumMotor() tank = MoveTank(OUTPUT_B, OUTPUT_C) STUD_MM = 8 mdiff = MoveDifferential(OUTPUT_B, OUTPUT_C, EV3Tire, 16 * STUD_MM) tank.gyro = GyroSensor() mdiff.gyro = GyroSensor() btn = Button() sound = Sound() sound.play_tone(880, 0.25) sound.play_tone(440, 0.25) library.choice(tank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms, motor, mdiff, steering,btn, sound) This program is fairly simple. It has standard imports, some typical definitions for the robot to run, and then it invokes the choice function from the library. The choice function is the main function that runs the robot. It is defined in the library.py file. Here is the code for the library.py file:\nimport bench import dance import bottom_right import step_slide import stepper import slide import input import treadmil import treadmil_gate def choice(tank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms, motor, mdiff, steering, btn, sound): while True: print(“ready for next command”) functionNumber = input.readKeys(btn, sound) print(functionNumber) if functionNumber == 1: bench.go(tank) elif functionNumber == 2: stepper.go(tank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms, motor, mdiff) elif functionNumber == 3: treadmil_gate.go(tank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms, motor, mdiff) elif functionNumber == 0: dance.dance_now(tank, steering) The choice function is a launcher for a program that we wrote to complete a mission. We used the buttons on the robot to define the variable functionNumber. Depending on the buttons that we pressed, the functionNumber would be different. This may seem extraneous, but this solves a major issue that ev3dev presents. If we were to do this normally and have a different program for each mission, the bootup time would be too long. So we used this launcher to invoke the function for each mission. Let’s take a look at the code for one of the missions:\nThe Stepper The goal is to push that green tab into the purple-and-black box.\nfrom time import sleep def go(tank, SpeedPercent, follow_for_ms, motor, mdiff): #forward fast 63cm tank.on_for_rotations(50, 50, 5.0) #forward slow 20cm for i in range(33): tank.on_for_rotations(5, 5, 0.05) sleep(0.03) #backward fast 32cm tank.on_for_rotations(-50, -50, 10) No imports, as you can see. There is no need for them, as library.py has the imports.\nSo this whole thing is a function that library invokes. First, the robot uses the tank function, which controls the robot’s wheels as a tank. It goes forward for 5 rotations, which is 63 cm. That takes us close to the stepper contraption. We go slower for 20 cm to push the stepper in using the tank function. Then we back out of there super fast to save time, coming back to the home base.\nThanks for reading!\nprint(\u0026#34;End of file.\u0026#34;) Note from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.

I am reposting it here for archival purposes. This article has been modified to fit the new blog.\nI have always thought about chess as a hobby. A simple game, and nothing more. Until a month ago. I realized that chess is so much more than just a game. There are strategies, tactics, gambits, baits and so much more. Let’s take a dive into the crazy world of chess.\nIn this, I will assume you know the rules of the game.\nA Basic Board This is a standard chess board. Two sides, with the power pieces in the back protected by a layer of pawns. There are three major parts of a chess game: openings, middlegames, and endgames.\nOpenings are where you set your pieces up for most of the games. It is very crucial to set things up correctly, otherwise you can lose the game very early on.\nMiddlegames are where most of the action takes place. Pieces are killed most frequently here, and some games are even won in midgame.\nEndgames are the result of a midgame. Many pieces are killed, and you are left with a few power pieces and pawns. Endgames can drag on for hundreds of moves, but can last only a few moves if you play your pieces correctly.\nToday, we are going to look at openings.\nBefore we go there, let’s establish a few things. The center of the board is a very important part of the board. It consists of these 4 squares: d4, d5, e4, and e5. Don’t know what these letters mean? No problem. These letters indicate a location on a board. This is called algebraic notation. Pieces are indicated as follows: Q for Queen, K for King, N for Knight, B for Bishop, R for Rook, and nothing for Pawns. x is used to indicate capture, + for check, and # for mate. ! is good move, !! is great move, ? is bad move, ?? is blunder, !? is interesting move, and ?! is dubious move. These concepts are very important.\nLet’s begin with openings. Openings are usually when you start to attack or be in the center. This is usually done by moving your pawns to the center. There are many well-known openings, but let’s look at a few. This is the standard King’s Pawn opening:\nKing\u0026#39;s Pawn Opening White moved to e4, and black responded with e5. This is a very popular and standard opening that most players use. The pawns stay at the center, and attack the two other center squares.\nLet’s look at another opening — The Sicilian Defense.\nSicilian Defense This may seem like a strange move for black. White moves the kings pawn to e4, and black moves to c5? This is actually a great move for black. Black is attacking the center (as indicated by the arrow) and shifting the game to the side, which is good for black. In addition, most consider it superior to 1\u0026hellip; e5 due to the aggressive nature of the opening.\nRuy Lopez was a chess master in the 1500s, and he created a variation on the King’s Pawn opening that many grandmasters use to this day. It shows a good development of power pieces, and shows a lot of pieces attacking the center.\nRuy Lopez I hope this article helped you.

Why does it matter? I think being an all-rounded person can help in many ways. Being a polymath allows you to unleash the creativity inside you. You can bring ideas to fruition. You can adapt with these constantly changing times. There are so many reasons why, I could probably write a whole 5 paragraph essay about it! I think my ELA teacher would like that. My point is that being a polymath is good for you and for others. It makes you more curious, and learn more about this wonderful world.\nHi there! My name is Rohan Arni. I’m a 7th grade student living in New Jersey. I love reading, math, science, technology, and music. I’m also a huge gamer. But most importantly, I’m curious. And I think that I have what it takes to be a true polymath. So I hope you enjoy my adventures of learning to be a polymath!Let’s start at the beginning. Who were the greatest polymaths ever? Well, if you look in history, three prominent names pop out at me. They are Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. They all have studied and made contributions to many different fields, but in the end, they all had two thing in common: curiosity and imagination. They were always looking for answers to problems, even daring to look in places that were considered forbidden. Especially da Vinci. That guy broke so many laws that at any point in his life he could be arrested for breaking 15 laws. So we know that curiosity is important. Another important skill is imagination. They were able to use their imagination to connect the dots between a variety of topics. da Vinci used his mathematical studies to paint! I don’t think many people in the 1400s were learning to paint, much less study math. So we have established that curiosity and imagination are the key to the mindset of being a polymath.\nNext, we need to look at the variety of topics they studied. They all studied more than 8 topics each. That’s why I have selected 8 topics. These topics are: science, technology, engineering, art, math, literature, sports, and gaming. I am passionate about learning about all of these topics, and sharing my learning with you!\nI hope you enjoy your stay at Path to Polymath!\n-Rohan\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2020 on my old blog on medium.
