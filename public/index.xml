      <title>Linear Regression and Free Will</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/free-will-regression/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do we have free will? That’s a question that’s haunted many philosophers, scientists, and people contemplating their existence late at night. We might find some answers in linear regression, of all the places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear regression can be simplified to drawing a line of best fit. Given any scattered set of data points, we want to create a line that best represents the shape of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple, 2D linear regression model is given by a general form&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Raytheon Radarange</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/technology-radarange/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/technology-radarange/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Raytheon Radarange was the first commercially available microwave. A clunky, chrome box weighing over 340 kg and costing over $5,000, the Radarange wasn’t widely adopted at the time. However, this artifact was chosen because it was a foundational step in advancing consumer food technology by changing the way Americans prepared food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Radarange was invented as a result of melted chocolate. In a Raytheon lab, Percy Spencer realized that his candy bar melted when he placed his chocolate bar next to a magnetron. Spencer realized that the magnetron (a special type of vacuum tube) was producing electromagnetic radiation, causing his chocolate bar to melt. Fascinated by this result, Spencer then took a bag of corn kernels and placed them near his magnetron, all of which popped into fresh, hot popcorn all over his lab. Presumably after a few laughs, Spencer and Raytheon realized the true potential of the technology they had on their hands and refined it to create the Radarange, sold starting in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is an advertisement for the Altair 8800 personal computer in the Popular Electronics Magazine. The Altair 8800 was the first commercially successful personal computer kit and was sold beginning in January 1975, when it was featured on the cover of the Popular Electronics magazine. This magazine had been the life and soul of the personal electronics culture in America, and being nominated to the cover marketed the Altair 8800 massively. It was sold as a DIY kit for around $400, and it was a plain metal box with switches and blinking lights. It was nowhere close to the PCs that consumers have today, but it was a massive success with the “hackers” of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Existentialism and Counterculture Through American History</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/existentialism-ush/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 09:10:42 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/existentialism-ush/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the moment we are born, there are expectations placed on us: go to school, find a job, start a family, build a life. Society gives us a blueprint on how to live a “meaningful” life. However, existentialism fundamentally rejects the premise that we have some “predetermined” purpose; instead, it suggests that it is up to an individual to find purpose in their life. Existentialists become aware of the “absurdity” of human existence: the fact that life itself lacks any inherent meaning beyond what we choose to give it. This problem, where humans seek purpose in a universe that offers none, leads to a dilemma: should we accept the illusion of meaning from society, or should we create our own?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Social Contract in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-contract-digital/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 09:10:42 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/social-contract-digital/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen the rise of many great empires and nations–Romans and their expansive empire, the British and their global dominance–only to see it crumble to dust. We can blame a lot of things on these collapses: new rising nations, changing technology, unexpected external factors. However, the collapse typically comes from within, as the relationship between the government and its citizens starts to crack and fail. This dramatic decay can be explained by a concept called the social contract. The social contract is one of the most important ideas in political philosophy (the study of the nature of politics, society, and the relationship between citizens and government). It states that citizens willingly consent to give up some personal freedoms to a governing authority, in exchange for the protection of their rights. To put it really simply, citizens give up some free will to gain protection from the government. The social contract was essential to the founding of the United States, but the digital age is bringing new changes to this centuries-old concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intuition to Gauss&#39;s Law</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: This article is the reason I got a five on AP Physics C, one year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauss&amp;rsquo;s Law is a law that relates the flux of the electric field on a surface to the charge enclosed within that surface. What does that even mean? In this article, I want to walk you through the basics of electromagnetism and make it seem like even you could have derived this law if you knew what Gauss knew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Harmonic Motion Isn&#39;t Very Simple</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is going to be math heavy. Be warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Google, an oscillator is a mechanical or electronic device that works on the principles of oscillation: a periodic fluctuation between two things based on changes in energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a system in equilibrium and give it a little kick, it will vibrate. We can model this with a cosine function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x = A \cos (\omega_0 t + \phi)$$&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relativity: Enter Einstein</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/relativity-two/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/relativity-two/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to reader: if you have not read part one, do so &lt;a href=&#34;https://rohanarni.com/posts/relativity-one&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was wrong with Galilean relativity? It help up perfectly well, until a Scottish mathematician by the names of James Clerk Maxwell created his four namesake laws of electricity and magnetism. As a consequence of his laws, he was able to derive the speed of light in a vacuum, which was given the variable $c$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, according to Galilean relativity, the speed of light seen by a moving observer should be the speed of light minus the moving observer:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relativity: Pre-Einstein</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/relativity-one/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/relativity-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to reader: This is the first in a series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relativity, we&amp;rsquo;ve heard so much about it. Created by Einstein, it&amp;rsquo;s lived in the minds of both physicists and the cultural zeitgeist. It&amp;rsquo;s the idea behind black holes, time travel, and has single-handedly spawned off so many Hollywood movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the beauty of special relativity, we must go back in time. Relativity is not a new concept that Einstein created; it&amp;rsquo;s been around since the time of Galileo and Newton. So what was this &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; relativity? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what relativity even means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hegelian Philosophy and the Modern Day</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&amp;rdquo; - George Santayana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present can seem like a very unstable and turbulent time. It seems as if the world is splitting itself apart, becoming more polarized and opinionated. However, to understand the direction the world is headed, we need to look back in the past for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Hegel is notorious for being incredibly difficult to read. His works are often long-winded and use poor english to convey his thoughts. However, his ideas are incredibly important to understand. However, one of his ideas is incredibly important to understand: the dialectic. When broken down, the dialectic is not a very complicated idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of human civilization, the night sky has captivated us in a way that no other object has. From the silvery moon rising in the sky to the tiny pinpricks of light we now know as stars and planets, humans have spent countless hours observing and documenting the night sky. The process began as far back as the Babylonians and their written record of the night sky, to the Mesoamerican civilizations who based a large majority of their calendar on the moon, and then the Indian and Arabic civilizations with their massive technological advancements to help observe the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Marbury V. Madison: The First Supreme Court Case</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/marbury-v-madison/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/marbury-v-madison/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On February 24, 1803, the first and most influential supreme court case of America occurred. This case lives in obscurity to most citizens, but without it, the Supreme Court would not have the power it has today. The issue of the case arose from a seemingly simple dispute. It all began during the Election of 1800. When incumbent president John Adams was voted out of office, he created a scheme to keep his party, the Federalists, in control of one of the branches of the government. Adams promoted many Federalists to become circuit judges and justices of peace. This way, the Federalist party could control the Judicial Branch of the government. However, one man that was promised a commission, William Marbury, never received one before Jefferson came into office. Jefferson declared the commission void and told his Secretary of State, James Madison, to not deliver the commission. Marbury sued Madison, and the court case began. The Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison changed America for the better because it established the principle of judicial review, increased the power of the Supreme Court, and protected the rights of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ev3 Projects: Car Following</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ev3carfollow/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 01:41:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ev3carfollow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is about a project I did with my Ev3 robot in which I made my Ev3 robot follow a toy car. This is similar to some features that many modern cars have today known as adaptive cruise control.. Let’s break this project down into three aspects: the thought process, the hardware, and the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought process is quite simple. I was inspired by my parents’ car, the Lexus RX 350. It has a feature that follows the car in front of it by keeping a constant distance from the other car. It can also speed up and down based on the speed of the other car. I thought that this would be quite easy to model with the Ev3 using principles from the PID line following algorithm. PID is an algorithm that “proportionally” follows a line. (I made a PID line follower on Github, which you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rtenacity/LineFollower&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) The algorithm uses how far away the robot is from the line to judge how much the robot should turn. Using the idea of proportionally following a target, I thought instead of following a line, I could make the robot follow a car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s time for my first tech review! Today, I’m gonna be talking about my new microphone, the Blue Snowball! You may have heard of its older brother, the Blue Yeti, which is a professional-grade large microphone, but Blue, a Logitech brand, made another microphone, called the Blue Snowball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Snowball is half the price of the Yeti at 49.99, and is half the size. It sports a unique design, with a three-legged stand and a ball-shaped microphone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. It’s been a while. Sorry for not writing at all! I’ve been pretty busy, but I didn’t write because I was very lazy. So anyways, I’m back! Let’s get into today’s topic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China. You can’t read the news without hearing about China. China is predicted to take over the US as the number one global superpower by 2032, and some estimate that to be even earlier. But how did this happen? As always, when you look at a topic, start with the basics. How did China begin, and how did their beginning differ from the US? Let’s dive into the birth of China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s on every high school classroom. But only a few people truly understand the secrets that the table holds. Today, let’s dive in to the true nature of the periodic table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a first glance, the periodic table looks like a childish table with all sorts of colors and silly letters. Most people know that those letters stand for elements. What are elements really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements are atoms. Atoms are comprised of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons, electrons, and neutrons determine which element it is. It also determines the properties of each element.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft: A classic example of popular trends reviving a once popular game. When it was first released, it was the hottest game to ever come out. A simple yet unique game. There was no clear objective in the game. It was an infinite world with the capability to do anything. No fancy graphics, no violent gore. How did such a simple game become so popular across the world? Today, let’s look at the rise, fall, and rise again of Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang is the cosmic event that started the entire universe. So what exactly happened? Well, it took scientists years to find out what exactly happened, but we finally have a somewhat complete idea of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole thing started with a singularity. The singularity is our whole universe, compressed into something smaller than a grain of sand. It’s even smaller than an atom. So for whatever reason, it implodes. Like, it goes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KABOOM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; All the information of the universe balloons out at blinding speed. This is where things start to get kooky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chess Openings, Part 2: Gambits</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/chess-part-two/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/chess-part-two/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I went over openings. Let’s recap the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always attack the center. The center is comprised of these 4 squares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/chess-part-two/images/1.png#layoutTextWidth&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algebraic notation is like the coordinate system for chess. ABC’s for the x axis, and numbers for the y axis. Each piece has a letter designated for its moves. X is for killing. Let’s see an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/chess-part-two/images/2.png#layoutTextWidth&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the knight were to take the pawn on e4, it would be written as Nxe4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mindstorms Ev3 Robot is a robot made by Lego. So obviously, there are competitions involving this robot. I participated in two of them. How did it go? Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s establish some context. My friend invited me to a robotics competition that his dad coached in summer of 2019. It was called First Lego League. It was all about making the Mindstorms Robot move around on this mat and do tasks on the mat, called missions. This is what the mat looked like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have always thought about chess as a hobby. A simple game, and nothing more. Until a month ago. I realized that chess is so much more than just a game. There are strategies, tactics, gambits, baits and so much more. Let’s take a dive into the crazy world of chess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Polymath (pol·y·math) - a person of wide-ranging knowledge or learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of being a polymath? Why does it matter? I think being an all-rounded person can help in many ways. Being a polymath allows you to unleash the creativity inside you. You can bring ideas to fruition. You can adapt with these constantly changing times. There are so many reasons why, I could probably write a whole 5 paragraph essay about it! I think my ELA teacher would like that. My point is that being a polymath is good for you and for others. It makes you more curious, and learn more about this wonderful world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
