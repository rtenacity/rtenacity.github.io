The singularity is our whole universe, compressed into something smaller than a grain of sand. It’s even smaller than an atom. So for whatever reason, it implodes. Like, it goes KABOOM.

This is where things start to get kooky.\nThere are 4 fundamental forces in physics: Electromagnetism, Gravity, the Strong, and the Weak force. At the beginning of the universe, all these 4 forces were united. As time passed on, (by time I mean a few milliseconds), these forces split off from one another. Gravity was the first to jump ship. Strong leaves next, leaving the “Electroweak” force left. Then those two split. A main goal of physics in the 21st century is to mathematically prove that all four forces can exist in the quantum model. The EM, strong, and weak force all fit into the quantum model because they all have force carrying particles. But gravity does not. What’s a force carrying particle? Check this page out.\nSo now we have 4 distinct forces. But we don’t have protons and neutrons yet. That’s because they are made of quarks, a fundamental particle. It was too hot for the quarks to come together. Now, with the temperature cooled slightly, the quarks could come together. But nothing would happen for another 400 thousand years. It was too hot for atoms to form. Then elements formed, then stars, then heavy elements, then planets, then earth, then life, and you know the rest.\nI hope you enjoyed this article!\n(It was also Einstein’s birthday on the day of writing.)\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.
