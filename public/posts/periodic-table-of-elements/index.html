Today, let’s dive in to the true nature of the periodic table.\nAt a first glance, the periodic table looks like a childish table with all sorts of colors and silly letters. Most people know that those letters stand for elements. What are elements really?\nElements are atoms. Atoms are comprised of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons, electrons, and neutrons determine which element it is. It also determines the properties of each element.\nElements have an atomic number and an atomic weight. An atomic number is the order in which it is on the periodic table. The atomic weight is the weight of all the components in the atom.\nThe periodic table are arranged in periods and columns. All the elements in one period have the same number of electron shells, and all the electron in one column have the same number of electrons in its outer, or valence, shell.\nThis is demonstrated by looking at the first column of the periodic table. All have one electron it its valence shell. This leads to a volatile metal (or gas, in the case of hydrogen), especially when it comes in contact with water. This is why sodium, an element in the first column, is known for its reaction with water.\nThere are 7 groups on the periodic table. There are Alkali Metals, Alkaline Earth Metals, Transition Metals, Metalloids, Other Metals, Non-metals, Halogens, Noble Gases and Rare Earth Elements. These all share similar characteristics. For example, the noble gases are known for not interacting with other elements.\nStay tuned for next week, where we go over some examples and go into further detail!\nThanks for reading!\nNote from the author: This article was written in 2021 on my old blog on medium.
