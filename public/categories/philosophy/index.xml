&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&amp;rdquo; - George Santayana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present can seem like a very unstable and turbulent time. It seems as if the world is splitting itself apart, becoming more polarized and opinionated. However, to understand the direction the world is headed, we need to look back in the past for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Hegel is notorious for being incredibly difficult to read. His works are often long-winded and use poor english to convey his thoughts. However, his ideas are incredibly important to understand. However, one of his ideas is incredibly important to understand: the dialectic. When broken down, the dialectic is not a very complicated idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
